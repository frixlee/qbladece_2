 * The TaperedElem class is designed to be a local element with in the FEM solution.
 * This function is responsible for creating the local element matricies. The Tapered Element
 * is a combination of two StructElem which contain the structral properties at each end.
 * Properties0 is designed to be the inner radial node and the Properties1 is the outer. This is not a
 * critical part of the maths more a convention followed through out the program to avoid confusion in programming.
 * Note: the gyroscopic matrix is not included as it is considered negligible and would be mean the
 * eigensolution would be solved via the duncan method. This object is essentially a c++ implementation of the CurveFEM
 * subroutines responsible for the element matricies. \n Ref: Dynamic Analysis Tool Development for Advanced Geometry Wind Turbine Blades
