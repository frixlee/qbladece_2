/*! This class takes the input coordinates and integrates over the areas to find the

* like a spar, inner or outer foil.
* This is achieved by implementing the integrals found in
* Hansens Aerodynamics of Wind turbines 2ed 2008 P109-111.
* The member variables are all named as seen in Hansen so if some of the mathematics doesn't immediately
* make sense consult the textbook.
