The QBlade Software
QBlade is a beyond the state of the art aero-servo-hydro-elastic code, covering the complete range of aspects required for wind turbine design, simulation, and certification. QBlade has been developed, tested, and validated during more than 10 years from the ground up, favoring a modular implementation of highly efficient novel aerodynamic, structural dynamic and hydrodynamic solvers in a modern, object-oriented C++ framework.
